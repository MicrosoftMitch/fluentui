A `Carousel` component is a sliding window of elements controlled by previous, next, and direct pagination buttons.

`Carousel` allows banners or a series of cards to be displayed in a way that takes up minimal screen space. It offers an accessible method of viewing content that is out of bounds via keyboard interactions while avoiding re-renders of CarouselCard.

`Carousel` offers multiple layouts of its controls via the 'CarouselNavContainer' which can be suitable for full screen banners, multiple cards within a view, or large image box previews and displays.

All regular methods of element sizing are available for CarouselCard, including width as a percentage of viewport or responsive sizing to internal content.
