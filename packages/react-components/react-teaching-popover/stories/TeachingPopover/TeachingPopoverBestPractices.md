## Best practices

### Do

Use TeachingPopoverCarousel for more complex features that require multiple steps of explanation
Provide media with appropriate and consistent sizing
Make use of the secondary button in single-page format to link more documentation, or links within descriptions of carousel if necessary.

### Don't

Use teaching popover to describe more than one feature at a time, multiple separate popovers can be localized to each feature and programmatically displayed for a 'walkthrough' of multiple features similar to callouts.
